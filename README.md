Hey folks ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer focused on Javascript and it's ecosystem but I also enjoy learning other technologies and programming languages.

I love to learn, follow good practices and add value to the teams I work with.

I think the best code is those that is easy to read (declarative), easy to change and easy to delete (decoupled and tested).

Get this is not an easy thing and requires a lot of practice, but if you achieves it you will be adding a lot of value to the product you are building, and most important thing, to the team you are working with.
